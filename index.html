    <h1>SOLID:</h1>

    <h3>S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one job.</h3>
    <h3>
      O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
    </h3>
    <h3>L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.</h3>
    <h3>
      I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should
      depend on abstractions.
